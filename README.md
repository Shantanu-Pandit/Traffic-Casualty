### Project Overview

This project aims to analyze traffic accident data and identify trends and insights related to casualties. The project will leverage several key performance indicators (KPI’s) to measure the severity and impact of traffic accidents, including the total number of casualties by accident severity, vehicle type, road type, and other factors.

### Goal:

This project aims to analyze traffic accident data and identify key trends and insights related to casualties. By doing so, the project aims to inform policy and decision-making related to road safety, and ultimately help reduce the number of casualties caused by accidents.

### KPIs:

#### 1. First Primary KPI:

Total Casualties were taken after the accident.

#### 2. Second Primary KPI:

Total Casualties and percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle

#### 3. Secondary KPI’s

Ø  Total casualties with respect to vehicle types

Ø  Monthly trend showing the comparison of casualties for the Current Year and the Previous Year

Ø  Maximum casualties by road type

Ø  Distribution of total casualties by road surface

Ø  Relation between casualties by area/location and by day/night


## I have executed this project using Microsoft Excel

### Activities Carried Out

#### 1. Getting dataset:

Data is available in the google drive link below:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1R_uaoZL18nRbqC_MULVne90h3SdRbAyn/edit?usp=sharing&rtpof=true&sd=true&pli=1

#### 2. Data Cleaning:

Duplication was removed, columns and rows adjusted, spelling checks were done and a few other things

#### 3. Data Analysis:

 (Using pivot tables and Excel formulas)

Pivot tables and pivot charts were created across different sheets with respect to achieving the KPI's. Thereafter a Data Analysis Sheet was created housing all the pivot tables earlier created for data analysis.
